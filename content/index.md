# Cookie Star

oh hi.

welcome to our kawaii world of java scripts.

you may be asking your self,

Why?

While we're not really certain why the universe exists,
we can provide some insight into the motivations behind cookie-star.js

cookie-star is the perfect blend of game engine and web meta framework.

Yes, you could just build something with three.js or react-three/fiber, 
and then go about building abstractions to handle user-input, describe layout of scenes, integrate a physics engine of some kind, use a library for networking and multiplayer, and workout a way to make your site content work on any device, vr, and even without javascript, (and we encourage that, if that's your calling.) 

In essence, cookie-star aims to provide an extensible light weight webgl game engine, driven by simple html and css, ideal for static sites.
